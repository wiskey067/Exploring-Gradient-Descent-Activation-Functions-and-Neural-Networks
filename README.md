# Exploring-Gradient-Descent-Activation-Functions-and-Neural-Networks
This repository contains an in-depth exploration of core neural network components and optimization techniques, implemented from scratch and with scikit-learn. It is divided into four key parts, focusing on gradient descent, activation functions, model training, and performance comparison across different network architectures and optimizers.
